        <p>
            You might be wondering why I joined the programme after reading my stellar biography. Well, as you
            <br>might tell by now I am the type of person who enjoys challenges and trying new things but to <br>
            be honest, I signed up for this program after I went through a tough heartbreak and needed something
            <br>to help me keep my mind distracted from the pain I was going through at the time. crazy! yeah?<br>
            well, Im glad I stumbled on the Kiki Mordis scholarship when I did and decided to try something entirely
            <br>new. I am also glad that I passed and got in because I have been enjoying this program so far.<br>
            Am I scared? Definitely!!, but I am a very smart and determined person and always finish whatever 
            <br>I set out to do, and this will be no exception. So heres to me learning and succeding and being<br>
            one of the best backend or even full stack engineer in Nigeria and hopefully the world.
